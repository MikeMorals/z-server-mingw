Tremulous Zombie Mod
==================

Yes, the infamous Zombie mod for the game Tremulous!

Building
-----------------------
MinGW make will build all qvms

Configuration
-----------------------
The Z QVM relies on addtional map layouts which can be found in the "layouts" directory.

If you are using the MySQL offerings, you will also need to specify your credentials in the server's config file.

Running
-----------------------
The Z QVM requires the xserverx 
tremulous dedicated server to run. You can find the code for this server here: https://github.com/IronClawTrem/xserverx-tremded/tree/nomysql
